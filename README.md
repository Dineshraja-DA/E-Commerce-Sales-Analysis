# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis
The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use Ecommerce Sales Dashboard that gives a clear view of key business metrics. It helps track sales, quantity sold, invoices processed, and stock availability for the most recent month. The dashboard makes it simple to identify trends, monitor performance, and make smarter decisions to boost growth.

Key Objectives:
---
Monitor Sales and Revenue Trends
  - Track total sales, revenue growth, and identify seasonal trends to optimize marketing and inventory.
Analyze Product and Regional Performance
  - Evaluate top-performing products and regions while identifying underperforming categories or locations.
Optimize Stock and Order Management
  - Maintain adequate stock levels, reduce holding costs, and ensure smooth order fulfillment to improve customer satisfaction.  

Key Insights from the Analysis
---
1. A few products and regions drive the majority of sales, indicating areas for potential scaling.
2. High discounts boost sales but reduce overall profit margins, requiring a balance between volume and profitability.
3. Monitoring stock levels helps prevent stockouts and overstocking, ensuring smooth order fulfillment.
4. Increased invoice processing efficiency suggests operational stability, with fewer discrepancies between orders and invoices.
5. Consistent growth in sales and revenue highlights increasing customer demand and effective marketing strategies.
